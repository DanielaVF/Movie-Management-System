# Movie-Management-System

The project is based on recreating an application for renting movies, with various functions and an available catalog. A menu with easy-to-use options was created so that the user can manage their profile in a simple way.

It is useful to manage the movie catalog account, the assigned administrator will have the power to have specific functions such as adding users and movies, as well as deleting them.

The main features of the application are the drop-down menu in 3 branches rent, return and manage. In each one you will have available options on what you want to do, whether it is renting a movie or viewing the history of how many movies have been rented. A great feature is that the administrator will be able to add or delete users or movies.
