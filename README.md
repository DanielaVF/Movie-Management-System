# Movie-Management-System

The project is based on recreating an application for renting movies, with various functions and an available catalog. A menu with easy-to-use options was created so that the user can manage their profile in a simple way.

The main features of the application are the drop-down menu in 3 branches rent, return and manage. In each one you will have available options on what you want to do, whether it is renting a movie or viewing the history of how many movies have been rented. A great feature is that the administrator will be able to add or delete users or movies.
